## Insights and Recommendations:

- User Ratings Impact 🌟: Top users wield significant influence through their ratings, necessitating careful handling to prevent bias.
- Rating Behavior 🌈: Users tend to favor higher ratings, making lower ratings a rarity, which affects our data pool.
- Movie Popularity 🏰: One movie commands substantial attention, while others are left with just a single rating.

## Strategies for Success:

- Encourage User Participation 🗡️: Actively prompt users to contribute ratings, especially for lesser-known films and infrequent raters.
- Leverage Watch Time 🕒: Incorporate watch time as a metric. Movies with shorter viewing times may be marked as less engaging if users exit early!
